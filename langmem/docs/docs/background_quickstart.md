# Background Quickstart Guide

Memories can be created in two ways:

1. In the hot path: the agent consciously saves notes using tools (see [Hot path quickstart](hot_path_quickstart.md)).
2. 👉**In the background (this guide)**: memories are "subconsciously" extracted automatically from conversations.

![Hot Path Quickstart Diagram](concepts/img/hot_path_vs_background.png)

This guide shows you how to extract and consolidate memories in the background using [`create_memory_store_manager`](). The agent will continue as normal while memories are processed in the background.

# Prerequisites

First, install LangMem:

```bash
pip install -U langmem
```

Configure your environment with an API key for your favorite LLM provider:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."  # Or another supported LLM provider
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.func import entrypoint
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

from langmem import ReflectionExecutor, create_memory_store_manager

store = InMemoryStore( # (1)!
    index={
        "dims": 1536,
        "embed": "openai:text-embedding-3-small",
    }
)  
llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

# Create memory manager Runnable to extract memories from conversations
memory_manager = create_memory_store_manager(
    "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    # Store memories in the "memories" namespace (aka directory)
    namespace=("memories",),  # (2)!
)

@entrypoint(store=store)  # Create a LangGraph workflow
async def chat(message: str):
    response = llm.invoke(message)

    # memory_manager extracts memories from conversation history
    # We'll provide it in OpenAI's message format
    to_process = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": message}] + [response]}
    await memory_manager.ainvoke(to_process)  # (3)!
    return response.content
# Run conversation as normal
response = await chat.ainvoke(
    "I like dogs. My dog's name is Fido.",
)
print(response)
# Output: That's nice! Dogs make wonderful companions. Fido is a classic dog name. What kind of dog is Fido?
```

1. What's a store? It's a document store you can add vector-search too. The "InMemoryStore" is, as it says, saved in-memory and not persistent.

    !!! tip "For Production"
    Use a persistent store like [`AsyncPostgresStore`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.postgres.AsyncPostgresStore) instead of `InMemoryStore` to persist data between restarts.

2. The `namespace` parameter lets you isolate memories that are stored and retrieved. In this example, we store memories in a global "memories" path, but you could instead use template variables to scope to a user-specific path based on configuration. See [how to dynamically configure namespaces](guides/dynamically_configure_namespaces.md) for more information.

3. We are using the memory manager to process the conversation every time a new message arrives. For more efficient processing patterns that let you debounce (aka avoid redundant) work, see [Delayed Memory Processing](guides/delayed_processing.md). You can also process memories directly with `memory_manager.process(messages)` if you don't need background processing.


If you want to see what memories have been extracted, you can search the store:

```python
# (in case our memory manager is still running)
print(store.search(("memories",)))
# [
#     Item(
#         namespace=["memories"],
#         key="0145905e-2b78-4675-9a54-4cb13099bd0b",
#         value={"kind": "Memory", "content": {"content": "User likes dogs as pets"}},
#         created_at="2025-02-06T18:54:32.568595+00:00",
#         updated_at="2025-02-06T18:54:32.568596+00:00",
#         score=None,
#     ),
#     Item(
#         namespace=["memories"],
#         key="19cc4024-999a-4380-95b1-bb9dddc22d22",
#         value={"kind": "Memory", "content": {"content": "User has a dog named Fido"}},
#         created_at="2025-02-06T18:54:32.568680+00:00",
#         updated_at="2025-02-06T18:54:32.568682+00:00",
#         score=None,
#     ),
# ]
```

!!! tip "For more efficient processing"

    💡 For active conversations, processing every message can be expensive. See [Delayed Memory Processing](guides/delayed_processing.md) to learn how to defer processing until conversation activity settles down.
